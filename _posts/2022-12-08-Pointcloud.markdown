**The project aims to help researchers output and display video of point cloud data based on user-defined paths. The input point cloud is processed in the following ways:**

- Color processing, such as rendering the color according to the specified axis as pseudo-color or setting the color according to user needs
- Coordinate transformation of the input point cloud to position it at the center
- Downsampling of the input point cloud to make the loading faster
