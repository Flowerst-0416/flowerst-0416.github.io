**This project aimed to design a system that generates electricity by using ocean wave energy for an intelligent fish farm.** <br />
<br />
**Design work:**<br />
    • Design the Power Take-Off System for the fish farm with 300 kN load input force to generate 35 kW power.<br />
    • Design and build the Power Take-Off System scale down version for verifying the feasibility of the design.<br />
    • Do the marketing research for a similar part and select the component for the three designs.<br />
**Technical Work:**<br />
    • Complete the CAD drawing by Solidworks and do the force analysis for each component to make them handle the large load input.<br />
    • Calculate the power level, bend stress and shear stress for each design to make sure all the versions can reach the expected power level.<br />
