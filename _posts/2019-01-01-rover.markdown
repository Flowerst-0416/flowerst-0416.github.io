Design work: /n
    • Design the Power Take-Off System for the fish farm with 300 kN load input force to generate 35 kW power. /n
    • Design and build the Power Take-Off System scale down version for verifying the feasibility of the design. /n
    • Do the marketing research for a similar part and select the component for the three designs. /n
Technical Work: /n
    • Complete the CAD drawing by Solidworks and do the force analysis for each component to make them handle the large load input. /n
    • Calculate the power level, bend stress and shear stress for each design to make sure all the versions can reach the expected power level. /n
