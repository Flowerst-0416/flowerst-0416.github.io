**The project aims to build a camera calibration toolbox based on robotic arm control. The goals of the project include:**

- Building a toolbox that improves calibration efficiency and accuracy
- Using a robotic arm to plan calibration paths according to the type of calibration in order to provide high-quality calibration samples
- Providing a validation method for completed calibration processes to enable rapid verification
- Types of calibrations include: camera intrinsic calibration, hand-eye calibration, and laser extrinsic calibration.
