**This project aim to design a system that combine advanced sense capability and plan to conventional manufacturing techniques.**
- Designed the end-effectors that incorporate the additive manufacturing process and install it on the Universal Robots Arm.
- Developed a fixed multi-arm platform with additive and inspection end effector to apply in the hybrid manufacturing process.
- Built a “3D copier” system based on the fixed multi-arm platform
