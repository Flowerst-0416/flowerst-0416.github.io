**This project aim to design a system that combine advanced sense capability and plan to conventional manufacturing techniques.**
- Develop a multi-mechanical system with additive, subtractive processing and laser scanner end-effector for aircraft inspection and maintenance
- Based on multi-mechanical platforms, develop a 3D copying and repair system for intelligent pipeline welding and hybrid machining solutions
- Construct a dual-arm system simulation environment to implement path coverage planning and real-time visual feedback applied to aircraft (Boeing 787) painting
- Build a self-developed robotic arm 3D scanner calibration tool system for fast and labor-saving hand-eye, camera extrinsic calibration and laser calibration
