**This project aim to add the sensing system to a Robotic Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (rWAAM) robot and do the real time motion adjustment base on the sensor feedback.**
- Design a real-time closed-loop control solution for arc metal 3D printing to improve metal printing quality and printing consumable costs
- Design a high-speed extrusion 3D printing system based on UR5e to simulate metal printing extrusion
