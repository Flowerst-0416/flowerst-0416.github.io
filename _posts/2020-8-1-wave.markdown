**This project aimed to design a system that generates electricity by using ocean wave energy for an intelligent fish farm.** 
- Design the electricity generating system with ocean wave energy to power the intelligent fish farm.
- Design the Power Take-Off System for the fish farm and Built the Power Take-Off System scale down version for prototype.

#### **Publication:**
